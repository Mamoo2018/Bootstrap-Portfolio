                            <p>I have a Bachelors of Commerce from the Ryserson University and an Advanced Business
                                Admin diploma from Humber. I had no experience in coding. Not the very slightest. After
                                shuffling a few jobs I landed a position in 2016 at Trader Corporation which manages
                                the autotrader.ca online marketplace and that is where things changed. I was slowly
                                being exposed to HTML, CSS and Javascript in my everyday work. I developed an interest
                                in it and decided to explorer the coding realm some more. I completed some online code
                                classes and started to enroll in college classes focused on a specific language, but
                                that wasn't enough. I wanted more. Fast forward two and a half years later and I am
                                enrolled in a Full Stack Development Bootcamp program.

                                In my spare time &#123if I have any&#125 I like to spend time with my family. I also
                                enjoy watching sports. Football, basketball, and baseball are among my top favourite</p>
